// This line changes the location of your images when creating UIs to be relative instead of within the ExtJS directory.
// You MUST set this to true/string value if you are creating new UIs + supporting legacy browsers.
// This only applies to new UIs. It does not apply to default component images (i.e. when changing $base-color)
// The value can either be true, in which case the image path will be "../images/"
// or a string, of where the path is
$relative-image-path-for-uis: false; // defaults to "../images/" when true
